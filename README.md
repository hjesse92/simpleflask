# My First Flask App

The app is deployed on Heroku: https://jessefirstflaskapp.herokuapp.com/

This app was created by following Jake's [tutorial video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1RJmh_OqeA). I added my own modifications and added the Author field for learning purposes.

Please checkout [Jake's Flask Repo](https://github.com/jakerieger/FlaskIntroduction).
